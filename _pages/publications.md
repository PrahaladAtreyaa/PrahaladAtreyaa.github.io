## Publications
- **Performance analysis of machine learning algorithms for fall detection (2019)**: This paper explores the use of machine learning (ML) in ambient assisted living systems (AALS) for fall detection, combining inertial motion unit (IMU) sensor data and vital signs. The authors collect a custom dataset to analyze how combining IMU features (e.g., acceleration, rotation) with vital sign parameters can improve ML performance compared to using either sensor type alone. They also test ML algorithms on two public datasets—one containing only IMU data and another with only vital signs—to highlight the benefits and trade-offs of different sensor inputs. The results demonstrate that fusing IMU and vital sign data can achieve more accurate, non-intrusive fall detection, advancing research on intelligent IoT-based AALS.
