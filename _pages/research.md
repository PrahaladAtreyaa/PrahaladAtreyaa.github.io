## Past Projects

- **SNP Detection in Liquid Biopsy**: In this work, we develop a machine learning model—specifically a Random Forest classifier—to distinguish genuine cancer-related variations in genomic reads from noise introduced by sequencing, alignment, or PCR errors. Traditional manual methods of refining variant calls are labor-intensive, prone to error, and rely heavily on read-level features alone. By incorporating base-specific attributes, our model assigns a probability score to each base at a given position (pileup column), enabling more accurate SNP calls with high specificity and sensitivity. This approach significantly reduces false positives and streamlines the variant-calling process compared to manual filters.
- **Resolution of River water allocation conflicts using game theory**: Global water scarcity is on the rise—by 2030, fresh water demand may exceed supply by 40% due to climate change, human activity, and population growth. Recent “Day 0” crises in major cities (e.g., São Paulo and Cape Town) highlight the urgent need for sustainable water management. In this project, we propose a two-level game-theoretic model for equitable and economically feasible water distribution, using Bengaluru (predicted to face severe water shortfalls) as a test case.

Level 1 (Allocation/Bargaining Game): Central authorities allocate water among states, reaching a Nash equilibrium either via non-cooperative or cooperative approaches.
Level 2 (Reaction Game): Key players—Environmental bodies, Industries, Citizens, and States—adjust strategies based on the initial allocations, aiming to maximize payoffs (in non-cooperative mode) or enhance overall outcomes (in cooperative mode).
The second-level game is modeled as a Finite Perfect Information Extensive Game, leading to a system of partial differential equations that, when solved, identify a Nash equilibrium for the reaction phase. Under cooperative modeling, the Shapley value can also be computed using sub-game perfect equilibrium payoffs.

By integrating game theory with real-world water usage and distribution patterns, this framework offers a robust tool for managing scarce resources and balancing diverse stakeholder interests—potentially reducing conflict and paving the way for sustainable water policies.
