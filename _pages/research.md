## Past Projects
- **SNP Detection in Liquid Biopsy**: Machine learning models for cancer prognosis.  
  - In this work, we develop a machine learning model—specifically a Random Forest classifier—to distinguish genuine cancer-related variations in genomic reads from noise introduced by sequencing, alignment, or PCR errors. Traditional manual methods of refining variant calls are labor-intensive, prone to error, and rely heavily on read-level features alone. By incorporating base-specific attributes, our model assigns a probability score to each base at a given position (pileup column), enabling more accurate SNP calls with high specificity and sensitivity. This approach significantly reduces false positives and streamlines the variant-calling process compared to manual filters.
